# Travel_Api
This travel api uses Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and Sequelize to create an account and plan a vacation. 

## DEPLOYED APP

## HOW IT WORKS
The traveller api demonstates my ability as a developer to successfully build a dynamic MYSQL database which returns "many-to many relationships" (https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html#many-to-many-relationships). This advanced take on using sequelize connects multiple models and routes in a single application. Enjoy!


## CODING LANGUAGES
Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and Heroku
